# Rusty-dealer

An attempt at a Bridge software suite for deal generation, simulation and performance analysis.
This started as  a reimplementation of [redeal](https://github.com/anntzer/redeal) by Antony Lee in Rust. Based on the super useful [bridge-cards](https://github.com/droundy/bridge-cards) by David Roundy.
Now... the project grew a bit and I'm now trying to turn this into a full fledged crate that can back some
decent software.

### Goals&Ideas:
- [ ] Create safe wrappers for all the DDS library (in progress)
- [ ] Find a better way to store shapes for a hand:
- [ ] Implement simulation of bridge situations
- [ ] Implement analysis of player performance

I'll add ideas and goals while I come up with them.
